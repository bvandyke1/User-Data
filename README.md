# User-Data

The purpose of this program is a simple one: it displays the data that was specific to my enrollment in Computer Science in 2019. I initiated and populated four string variables, consisting of the course name, assignment name, my name, and the due date. The output printed consists of the data in these four variables, as well as "ascii art" forming the sentence "I can program". There is no input required of the user for this program, and it is written in C++.
